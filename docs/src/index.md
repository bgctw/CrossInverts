## Problem

When calibrating models across different groups, some parameters should
be kept constant across sites (fixed parameters), some are allowed to vary 
around a common mean across sites (random parameters), and others may
be allowed to vary freely across groups (individual parameters).

Specifying priors and and dealing with groups and individuals require some
common support.
Further, keeping the overview across different scenarios can be tedious.
